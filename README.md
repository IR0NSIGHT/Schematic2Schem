Schematic2Schem is a command line tool for converting MCEdit Schematics (.schematic, Minecraft version 1.12 and below) to Sponge Schematics (.schem, Minecraft version 1.13 and above).

[Just give me the frigging .exe sweaty nerd](https://github.com/IR0NSIGHT/Schematic2Schem/releases)

It is based on https://github.com/McJeffr/schematic2schem and was commissioned by @Lans to a freelancer for the worldpainter discord community.
Lans asked me to upload it to github, to make it publically avaialbe for everyone.
