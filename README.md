Schematic2Schem is a command line tool for converting MCEdit Schematics (.schematic, Minecraft version 1.12 and below) to Sponge Schematics (.schem, Minecraft version 1.13 and above).
It is based on https://github.com/McJeffr/schematic2schem and was commissioned by @Lans to a freelancer.

Lans asked me to upload it to github, to make it publically avaialbe for everyone.
